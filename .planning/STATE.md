# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** A single API request delivers a message through any configured channel with automatic fallback — without per-message markup, without vendor lock-in, and with full custody of transaction data on infrastructure you control.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-25 — Phase 1 planned (4 plans, 20 requirements, walking skeleton)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase decomposition — foundation schema decisions locked in Phase 1 before any message flows (research-validated ordering: expensive-to-retrofit schema goes first)
- [Roadmap]: WhatsApp Web (highest-risk channel) + all durability machinery (dedup, terminal-session, goroutine lifecycle) lands in Phase 4 with the queue — not deferred to official channels phase
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 (Admin Shell) and Phase 3 (Ingest API & Queue) are independent after Phase 1 and may execute in parallel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research flag]: Phase 4 — WhatsApp ban-risk + whatsmeow version drift surface needs phase-specific research during planning (whatsmeow issue #810 still open)
- [Research flag]: Phase 5 — WABA template + 24h window specifics need primary-source verification against Meta docs (Facebook docs blocked during research)
- [Research flag]: Phase 6 — Webhook HMAC signing scheme choice (HMAC-SHA1 a la Twilio vs secret_token header a la Telegram) needs brief design pass
